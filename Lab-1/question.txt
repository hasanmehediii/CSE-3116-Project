Objectives

By the end of this lab, students will be able to:
Understand the basic architecture of a microcontroller.
Set up a development environment (IDE, compiler, programmer).
Configure GPIO pins as input and output.
Write, upload, and debug basic microcontroller programs.
Implement a simple input–output control system (button → LED).

Required Equipment
Microcontroller board (Arduino Uno / STM32 Nucleo / ESP32 / PIC board)
USB cable & programmer/debugger (if needed)
Breadboard & jumper wires
LED (1–2 pcs), push button (1 pc)
Resistors: 220 Ω (for LED), 10 kΩ (for button pull-down)
Computer with IDE installed (Arduino IDE / STM32CubeIDE / MPLAB X depending on MCU)

Pre-lab Preparation
Read about the differences between microcontrollers and microprocessors.
Review microcontroller architecture: CPU, Flash memory, RAM, I/O ports.'
Install the required IDE and drivers for your platform.


Lab Activities

Part A: Toolchain Setup (30 min)
Connect the microcontroller board to your computer.
Open the IDE, select the correct board and COM port.
Upload a sample “Hello World” program (LED blink).

Example (Arduino C code):

void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);   // Set pin 13 as output
}
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // LED ON
delay(1000);            // Wait 1 sec
digitalWrite(13, LOW);  // LED OFF
delay(1000);            // Wait 1 sec
}

Part B: Digital Input (45 min)
Wire a push button to pin 2 with a pull-down resistor.
Modify the code to read the button state.
Print button status to the Serial Monitor.

Example snippet:
int buttonPin = 2;
void setup() {
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop() {
  int state = digitalRead(buttonPin);
  Serial.println(state);
  delay(200);
}

Part C: Input → Output Control (1 hr)
Connect LED to pin 8.
Write a program where the LED turns ON only when the button is pressed.
Extend: Press → LED toggles state (like a switch).

Part D: Debugging Practice (30 min)
Use Serial.print() (or debugger breakpoints) to observe variable values.
Introduce deliberate error (wrong pin, missing resistor) → troubleshoot.

Assessment Questions
What is the main difference between microcontrollers and microprocessors?
Why do we need a pull-down resistor on the button input?
If you press the button quickly, why might the LED not always respond? (hint: bouncing)
Modify your program so that the LED stays ON for 5 seconds after a button press.
