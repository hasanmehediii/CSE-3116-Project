Lab 3: ADC/DAC and Sensor Interfacing

Objectives

Learn how analog values are converted to digital.
Read real-world sensor data via ADC.
Process analog signals (simple filtering).
Output analog-equivalent signals using DAC/PWM.

Required Equipment
Microcontroller board with ADC (Arduino Uno, STM32, PIC)
Potentiometer, temperature sensor (LM35 or TMP36)
LED for PWM brightness test
Oscilloscope (if available)

Pre-lab Preparation
Read datasheet section on ADC resolution and sampling rate.
Revise voltage dividers.
Review PWM concept for simulating analog output.


Lab Activities

Part A: Read Analog Signal (45 min)
Connect potentiometer to ADC pin.
Display value on Serial Plotter.
int potPin = A0;
void loop() {
  int val = analogRead(potPin);
  Serial.println(val);
  delay(100);
}


Part B: Sensor Interfacing (45 min)
Connect temperature sensor.
Convert ADC reading to Celsius.
Print to Serial Monitor.

Part C: Filtering (30 min)
Apply moving average to smooth noisy sensor values.

Part D: DAC/PWM Output (1 hr)
Use PWM pin to fade LED brightness based on potentiometer input.
Generate a triangle/sine wave via DAC on STM32 and observe with oscilloscope.
